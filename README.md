# paging-simulation-system
This Python code simulates the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm. It includes functions to track frame states during the simulation, record the history of frames, and compare page fault counts for different memory capacities. The main block demonstrates these functions with a sample page request sequence.
